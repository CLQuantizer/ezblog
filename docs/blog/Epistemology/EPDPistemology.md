# An epistemology based on parallel distributed processing

I seek to think in the way JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber thinks.

When asked about what consicousness is by [Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FIo6evmweo) 
Schmidhuber answered: When we have an LSTM as a predictive model of the world which minimizes pain and
other undesired shit

> Compression, or model making, is a sub-process of prediction. During the training phase, the LSTM is naturally optimized in such a way that it constructs models which represent parts of the "self". The relationship between the LSTM and these models is consciousness.

Epistemology primarily seeks to answer this question: what is knowledge?

We will have to answer it in a Schmidhuberig way.

How do we do that?
