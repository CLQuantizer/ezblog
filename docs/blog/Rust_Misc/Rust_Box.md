I ask this question: what does Box<T> do in Rust?

ChatGPT says:

In Rust, a Box<T> is **a smart pointer** that allocates memory on **the heap**, rather than on the stack.

It is used when you want to store data on the heap, 
but do not know the exact size of the data at compile time, 
or when you want to transfer ownership of an allocated piece of memory to a different part of your code.

A Box<T> is implemented as a wrapper around a raw pointer, 
and it automatically handles the details of allocating and deallocating memory on the heap. 


When a Box<T> is dropped, the memory it points to is automatically deallocated, 
which makes it easy to avoid memory leaks.

Here is an example of using a Box<T> to **store a string on the heap**:

```
let b = Box::new(String::from("Hello, World!"));
println!("{}", b);
```
**Another question here**: if I did not Box it, would the String not be stored on the heap?

ChatGPT does not actually know this.

Box<T> is also used when you want to store a struct on the heap 
and also want to get the ownership of the data, for example:

```
struct MyStruct {
    data: i32,
}
let my_struct = Box::new(MyStruct { data: 5 });
```
One important thing to note is that Box<T> can't be used 
in certain contexts where the size of the type is needed at compile time, 
such as in the case of arrays and certain types of collections. 
For those cases, you can use Vec<T> and VecDeque<T> types.

Box<T> is useful when you want to store complex data types on the heap, 
and you want to transfer ownership of the data around your code 
without worrying about the details of memory management.

## Common methods associated with Box<T>
    new(x: T) -> Box<T>: 
        This method creates a new Box<T> that points to a value of type T on the heap. 
        It takes one argument, which is the value to be stored in the box.
    deref(&self) -> &T: 
        This method returns a reference to the data stored in the Box<T>. 
        It allows you to access the data stored in the box as if it were a regular variable.
    deref_mut(&mut self) -> &mut T: 
        Similar to deref, but returns a mutable reference to the data stored in the box.
    drop(&mut self): 
        This method is called when a Box<T> goes out of scope. 
        It deallocates the memory that the box points to.
    into_raw(b: Box<T>) -> *mut T: 
        This method converts a Box<T> into a raw pointer. 
        It takes a Box<T> as an argument and returns a raw pointer to the data it points to.
    from_raw(ptr: *mut T) -> Box<T>: 
        This method creates a Box<T> from a raw pointer. 
        It takes a raw pointer as an argument and returns a Box<T> that points to the same data.
## Conclusion
I did not understand what is going on. I am still using the mental model for Java Box. Whatever bruv. I don't really care
